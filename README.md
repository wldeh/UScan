## Overview

UScan allows you to scan the UPC of any supplement product to receive a comprehensive profile that includes certifications, safety information, and more. Designed with usability in mind, it offers a streamlined experience free from unnecessary distractions or advertisements.

UScan aggregates data from multiple sources including the NIH DSLD, USDA Food Data, and our proprietary analysis tool to provide the information you need to make informed decisions.

The [UScan API](https://github.com/wldeh/UScan-API) checks product ingredients and certifications against extensive databases of non-compliant items.
